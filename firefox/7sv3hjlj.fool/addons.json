You can easily set custom \"user-agent\" strings from the toolbar popup\n2. The extension uses a two-factor technique to mimic your default \"user-agent\" string, which is the most reliable method\n3. The extension does not use any resources when it is not spoofing the user-agent\n4. The extension enables user-agent spoofing on specific domains only; it is conversely possible to exclude certain domains from spoofing. Check the Options page for more info.\n5. You can set per-site user-agent strings\n6. There is an option to randomize user-agent strings.\n7. It is possible to set user-agent string for a single window; you can have a separate user-agent string for each browser window\n\nSupported operating systems:\nWindows, Mac OS, Linux, Chromium OS, Ubuntu, Debian, Android, iOS, AmigaOS, OpenBSD, BeOS, Haiku, Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Slackware, SUSE, gentoo, Fedora, Gentoo, Mageia, CentOS, Mint, DragonFly, Kubuntu, Mandriva, Zenwalk, Unix, GNU, OS/2, AIX, QNX, BEOS, RISC OS, Symbian, Nintendo, OpenSolaris, Kubuntu\n\nSupported browsers:\nInternet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, WebKit, Avant, Maxthon, Arora, Mozilla, Epiphany, Camino, Chimera, Chromium, Dragon, conkeror, Conkeror, Dillo, Links, Firebird, Swiftfox, Netscape, Flock, iCab, Iceape, icecat, IceCat, IceWeasel, Iron, Meleon, Konqueror, Lunascape, Lynx, MAXTHON, midori, Midori, KHTML, Mosaic, NetSurf, OmniWeb, Tablet, Mini, Phoenix, RockMelt, Safari, Browser, SeaMonkey, Slim, Webkit, w3m\n\nFor more info and general bug reports please use:\nhttps://add0n.com/useragent-switcher.html\n\nFor technical bug reports please use:\nhttps://github.com/ray-lothian/UserAgent-Switcher/","weeklyDownloads":8244,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Ray","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13129494/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/188/188200.png?modified=1622132777","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/188/188200.jpg?modified=1622132777","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/202/202435.png?modified=1622132779","width":440,"height":280,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/202/202435.jpg?modified=1622132779","thumbnailWidth":440,"thumbnailHeight":280}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/addondonation/10usd?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.3227,"reviewCount":160,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher/reviews/","updateDate":1620231736000},{"id":"jid1-BoFifL9Vbdl2zQ@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/521/521554-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/521/521554-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/521/521554-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Decentraleyes","version":"2.0.17","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3902154/decentraleyes-2.0.17-an+fx.xpi","homepageURL":"https://decentraleyes.org","supportURL":"https://decentraleyes.org","description":"Protects you against tracking through \"free\", centralized, content delivery.
